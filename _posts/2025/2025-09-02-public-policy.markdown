**Domain Wars** is the struggle between cybercriminals registering domain names for their illicit endeavors and defenders (such as law enforcement, security researchers, and policy makers) 
trying to stop these malicious domain registrations.

**Are we losing the Domain Wars?** Despite the efforts of security researchers, law enforcement, and policy makers, it appears that we are losing the domain wars. 
Researchers from [Interisle](https://gac.icann.org/presentations/public/Interisle%20GAC%20Presentation%20June%202025.pdf) and [ICANN](https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/daar-monthly-report-30sep24-en.pdf), 
among others, have found that the number of malicious domain registrations has been sharply increasing in recent years. 
Further, [UNIT 42](https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/typo-domain-generation-algorithms/) and [Centripetal](https://www.centripetal.ai/threat-research/revolver-rabbit-and-the-rise-of-rdgas) discovered a new trend 
where malicious actors register hundreds of thousands of domains for single campaigns, potentially spending millions of USD on domain registration fees.

**The Role of Public Policy in Combating Malicious Domain Registrations.** Both public policy and detection capabilities are vital to have a winning chance in the domain wars. 
I share here the slides I presented to the Law and Policy Subcommittee of the Maryland Cybersecurity Council. 
[In this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aNUMy1QyLew8hjVG6_B68E7c6LkeEg0s3bbcAUX56fs/edit?usp=sharing), 
I explore past research and a variety of policy ideas, including: increasing domain registration price, strict identity verification, limiting the number of domains a registrant can buy, 
incentivizing registrars and registries, and progressive domain pricing.
