I am a researcher at [Palo Alto Networks](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/) working on DNS security, web security and threat intelligence. Previously, I did my Ph.D. research advised by [Nicolas Christin](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/) at [CyLab](https://www.cylab.cmu.edu/), [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/). During my Ph.D. I have spent two incredible summers at LinkedIn with the anti-abuse team. My first exposure to research in computer security was at the [CrySyS Lab](https://www.crysys.hu/) of [Budapest University of Technology](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en), where I was advised by [Mark Felegyhazi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felegyhazi/) and received my M.Sc. degree.
